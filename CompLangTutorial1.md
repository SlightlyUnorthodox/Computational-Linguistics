#Introduction to R with RStudio

[](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png)

R is a programming language designed particulary for use by statisticians and data scientists, but because of its vast library of packages it has uses that far surpass its original design.

A number of packages have been made in R for the specific purpose of Computational Linguistics, one of which we'll work with today in a brief demonstration.

*As a bit of a lengthy aside, I'd like to note that when approaching problems in Computational Linguistics and other fields, the specific programming language you use can matter either a lot or not at all. For example, just about everything that you can do in R can also do with Python, however the specific tool you want to use might only exist in one or other. In another case, the data you work with might be so large that you can't use either programming language in any efficient way. In summation, what's important when learning technical skills of this nature is not learning how to code, but how to approach a problem with what you do know and also to know when you need to learn new skills and techniques.*


## Installing R

#### Step One

Download and install the R base [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)

#### Step Two

Download and install RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

## Demo




## For Those Interested In Learning More

#### The CRAN Library

CRAN, short for The Comprehensive R Network has a library containing thousands of packages which is update regularly. It happens to have several libraries of interest to computational linguistics of which the following are a few.

* NLP, found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NLPutils/index.html) with [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NLP/NLP.pdf)
* NLP

#### Tutorials

If you're interested in learning more about programming in R, Swirl tutorials can be downloaded and run directly in RStudio using the following commands.

  > install.packages("swirl")
  
  > library(swirl)
  
  > swirl()
  
The full library of swirl commands is available [here](https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses)
